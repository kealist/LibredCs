# Simple LibRed Binding for C#

This project allows the usage of [Red programming language](http://www.red-lang.org/) in C#.   Currently it exists in it's simplest state.  Review the [documentation for LibRed](https://doc.red-lang.org/en/libred.html) to see the functions provided.   A more native interface is coming to use common C# types under the hood
